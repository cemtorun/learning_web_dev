# Section 8: Bootstrap 4

Alpha, beta and then stable releases.

- alpha and beta can still have major changes
- after stable release they won't be any major changes

## Changes from Bootstrap 3 to 4

Flexbox is a model for laying out your webpage.

- Enabled by default
- Bootstrap 4 is built on flexbox whereas BS 3 wasn't

Main unit that was used in bootstrap 3 was pixels (px), but in bootstrap 4, that unit is now something called rem.

- a relative unit that allows us to scale the size of things based on a global font size.
- global font size is 16px so rems are based on this global size.

5th tier for the grid system

- 5 screen sizes ranging from xs, sm, md, lg, and xl

Dozens of new utlity classes for padding and margin.

Alots of syntax is different

New component called cards that replaces panels, thumbnails and wells.

- cards is an all encompassing component for these 3 old components.

No more glypicons, we have to include our own.

- we did this and used font awesome so no worries!

## Getting Started with Bootstrap 4

Need the css cdn as usual. Also need jQuery and this new one called popper for drop downs and pop ups and lastly the normal js file like in BS 3.

## Bootstrap 4 Colors and Background

Both BS 3 and 4 take advantage of contextual color classes like danger, warning, info, primary, success, etc both with buttons and text.

- bs 4 has some more colors like secondary, light, dark, etc.
- can always change and play around with these colors.
- .text-secondary, .text-info, etc
- .bg-primary, .bg-warning, etc

## Typography
