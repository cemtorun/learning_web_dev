# Section 31: RESTful Routing

## Intro to REST

REST = Representational state transfer

- it is a mapping between HTTP routes and CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DESTROY)
- REST is a pattern for defining routes
- it is just a convention / architechture for mapping HTTP routes to CRUD functionality
- we dont just make "/whatever", with REST there is a pattern to what comes after the "/"
