# Section 28: YelpCamp Basics

When doing a post request in order to update a page, i.e. add a campsite. The post request url and the get request url should be the exact same url.

- this is a convention that is important to follow
- this is called RESTful routing

If we want to test if a post request works, we can just add a res.send and put the url into postman as a post request and we can see if it works w/o actually having to write any additional code.
